# Advanced

```admonish warning
This documentation covers an older API of Moly Kit. The documentation will be reworked. For reference, commit `1eb9630` is the last commit where this documentation was valid.
```

This section covers advanced topics that are typically not necessary unless you
need to extend Moly Kit beyond its built-in features. These chapters will guide
you through more complex customizations and integrations.
